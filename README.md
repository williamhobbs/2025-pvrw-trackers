# 2025-pvrw-trackers

This repository is for the 2025 NREL PVRW poster "Going beyond stuck trackers: how well do your trackers work?" by Will Hobbs and Kevin Anderson. 

A preprint of the poster is available here, [poster/2025_pvrw_trackers_print_rev2_preprint.pdf](poster/2025_pvrw_trackers_print_rev2_preprint.pdf).

Check out [examples.ipynb](examples.ipynb) for examples of modeling tracker "non-idealites." It uses the `model_pv_power()` function from `pv_model.py` in [https://github.com/williamhobbs/pv-system-model](https://github.com/williamhobbs/pv-system-model), which is based on [1].
